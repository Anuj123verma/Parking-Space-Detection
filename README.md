# Parking-Space-Detection
In this project I have made a mode for countries like India, using this model we can detect the free spaces where we can park our vehicles (two wheeler, three wheeler, or four wheeler) .
Here I am attaching some pictures and for details you can refer to the pdf shared.
I am attaching the link for the app where you can download it too. Please use the GPU.
