# Parking-Space-Detection
In this project I have made a mode for countries like India, using this model we can detect the free spaces where we can park our vehicles (two wheeler, three wheeler, or four wheeler) .
Here I am attaching some pictures and for details you can refer to the pdf shared.
I am attaching the link for the app where you can download it too. Please use the GPU.
The label "0" is for can't parked, the label "1" is for can parked here.
